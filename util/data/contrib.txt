=== Creating an unpacker ===
;;;;
-Add the code to recognize the format in the recognize() function in the unpack._formats.py module
-You can just add the magic in the MAGICS dict with the format name if it's a 4-bytes or 2-bytes magic at the start of the file
-You can just add the file name extension in the EXTS dict with the format name if the format can only be recognized with file name extension
-If you need the byte order to be specified, add the format name in the NEEDS_ENDIAN tuple
-If the decompression should be skipped, for example if the start of the file can be anything and can be misrecognized by the decompressor, add the format name in the SKIP_DECOMPRESSION tuple

-You don't have to edit anything else in unpack/__init__.py or 3DSkit.py
;;;;
-Then, use the newmod plugin to create your template and follow the instructions
-run python3 3DSkit.py -g newmod
-You can now edit your module.
