TXTREE (here noted "TXtree") is an homemade format to represent tree data in a human-readable form. It is used by 3DSkit to represent some information formats (like layouts...) as a readable format. More info on the txtree repo at https://github.com/Tyulis/txtree

"files" means that the format is an archive format, and those files are simply extracted.

Images are extracted as PNGs

"sections" means that the file is simply splitted into his internal section (these sections, for example in NCCH, might be extracted then)
