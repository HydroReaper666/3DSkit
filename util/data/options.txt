Packing
=============

Required arguments:
	-p: Specify that you want to pack a readable file into a 3DS/WiiU file
	
	-f [output format]: Output format
		To get it, look at the extraction console output, which looks likes this:
			No compression
			[File format] file found
			Extracting...
			(...)
			Extracted!
	
	-o [file name]: Specify the output file name
	-l OR -b: Specify the endianness of the output file.
		-l for little and -b for big endian.
		It is default to little endian.
		You have to use -l for 3DS files and -b for WiiU files
;;;;

Optional arguments:
	-d: 
		For packing archives, you can either specify each files like this:
			python 3DSkit.py -xf SARC -o Help.sarc help/file1 help/file2 help/file3
		Note that this will take full relative path from 3DSkit.py, so files names will be stored as help/file
		Or like that:
			python 3DSkit.py -xdf SARC -o Help.sarc help
		In that case, the whole specified directory will be packed, and paths will start at the directory, so in this case, file names will be just 'file'
		The usage of this option is VERY recommanded to avoid problems and too long argument lists...
	
	-c [compression]:
		This option specify the compression to use. To get it, look at the extraction console output:
			Compression: [compression]
			SARC file found
			Extracting...
			(...)
		If you read 'No compression', this option is not needed
	
	-O(option=value)
	-O(option1=value1; option2=value2; ...)
		Use this option to specify format-specific options, like color format to repack BFLIM and BCLIM...
		These options are specific to the file format, so see supported formats help for more details
