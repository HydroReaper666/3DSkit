;;;;

=============

Required arguments:
	-x: Specify that you want to extract the file
	OR
	-t: lists the files contained in an archive
;;;;

Packing
=============

Required arguments:
	-p: Specify that you want to pack a readable file into a 3DS/WiiU file
	
	-f [output format]: Output format
		To get it, look at the extraction console output, which looks likes this:
			No compression
			[File format] file found
			Extracting...
			(...)
			Extracted!
	
	-o [file name]: Specify the output file name
	-l OR -b: Specify the endianness of the output file.
		-l for little and -b for big endian.
		It is default to little endian.
		You have to use -l for 3DS files and -b for WiiU files
;;;;

Specific arguments:
	-v [version}: Specify the version of output files.
		These formats need version for packing:
			GARC, which can use 4 (mainly for 6G Pokémon games), or 6 (mainly for 7G Pokémon games)
		To get it, look at console output:
			Extracting...
			Version: [version]
			Extacted!
		If there is not this line, version is not needed
	-s [swizzle type]: Specify the swizzling type to use on textures.
		It is used only for textures (BFLIM, BCLIM), and can have these values:
			0: no swizzling
			4: Rotate 90º
			8: Transpose
		Look at console output to get the swizzling type:
			(...):
				Swizzle type: [swizzle type]

Optional arguments:
	-d: 
		For packing archives, you can either specify each files like this:
			python 3DSkit.py -xf SARC -o Help.sarc help/file1 help/file2 help/file3
		Note that this will take full relative path from 3DSkit.py, so files names will be stored as help/file
		Or like that:
			python 3DSkit.py -xdf SARC -o Help.sarc help
		In that case, the whole specified directory will be packed, and paths will start at the directory, so in this case, file names will be just 'file'
		The use of this option is VERY recommanded to avoid problems and too long argument lists...
	
	-c [compression]:
		This option specify the compression to use. To get it, look at the extraction console output:
			Compression: [compression]
			SARC file found
			Extracting...
			(...)
		If you read 'No compression', this argument is not needed
