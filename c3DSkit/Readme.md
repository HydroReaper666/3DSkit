# c3DSkit

This is the source directory of c3DSkit, the 3DSkit's C extension.
To build, run `python3 setup.py install`. You need a working C compiler and the Python includes (should be included in your python installation)

When you update c3DSkit, it may be required to remove the `build` directory.
