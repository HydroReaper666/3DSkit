3DSkit
======

3DSkit is a tool to extract and repack many files formats found on the NDS, DSi, 3DS and WiiU
For help and informations on use and options, read the wiki or use the -H option of 3DSkit

What does 3DSkit?
=================

3DSkit can:

*	Extract and convert many files formats found in 3DS, WiiU, and why not NDS games
*	Pack or repack them
*	Decompress, and soon compress these files with their original compression

How to use
==========

	usage: 3DSkit.py [-h] [-H] [-t | -x | -p | -D | -C | -g PLUGIN] [-d] [-f FORMAT] [-l | -b] [-o OUT] [-c COMPRESSION] [-O OPTIONS] [files [files ...]]

		-o OUT, --out OUT     Output file name (only for repacking)
		-c COMPRESSION, --compression COMPRESSION
								Output compression type
		-O OPTIONS, --options OPTIONS
								Format-specific options, see help for details

Format-Specific options
=======================

Specify these options with the -O option (see options help)
You can specify them with -O{option=value} or -O{option1=value1;option2=value2}

**At extraction**:

*	NCCH / ExeFS:
	*	**dochecks**: If "true", checks if the contents hashes match. Defaults to false.

**At packing**:

*	BFLIM:
	*	**format**: Specify the color format. Can be: RGBA8, RGBA4, RGB8, RGB565, RGBA5551, LA8, LA4, L8, L4, A8, A4. Note that this will have an effect on color quality and file size, but not on the functionment of the game, you can repack in a different format  of original without any problem, for example for ETC1, not supported at packing. Defaults to RGBA8
		
	*	**swizzle**: Specify the texture swizzling (see console output at extraction). Can be 0 (none), 4 (90ยบ rotation) or 8 (transposition). Defaults to 0

Supported formats
=================

Info on the table:

*	X (Extract): 3DSkit can extract these files
*	P (Pack): 3DSkit can create and pack these files from scratch
*	R (Repack): 3DSkit can only repack files which have been extracted by 3DSkit
*	Extensions: Frequent file extensions or names for this format (all formats can sometimes have the .bin extension)

Crosses:

*	x : full support
*	e : experimental / untested
*	p : partial support
*	n : not functional
*	b : bugged
*	  : no support
	
Output: Output format at extracting. See the output formats help for informations

	Format | X | P | R | Extensions          | Output
	--------------------------------------------------
	ALYT   | x |   | x | .alyt               | files
	BCLYT  | p |   |   | .bclyt              | TX
	BCSAR  | b |   |   | .bcsar              | files
	BFLIM  | x | x |   | .bflim              | PNG
	BFLYT  | x |   | x | .bflyt              | TX
	BL     | e |   | e | .bl (none)          | files
	CBMD   | e |   |   | .bnr banner[.bin]   | files
	DARC   | x | e |   | .arc .bcma (...)    | files
	GARC   | x |   |   | .garc (none)        | files
	GFA    | x |   |   | .gfa                | files
	NCCH   | x |   |   | .app .cxi .cfa      | sections
	NDS    | x |   |   | .nds                | files
	SARC   | x | x |   | .sarc .arc .szs     | files

There is also:

*	unpack.ExtHeader:
	*	Unpacks NCCH extended headers (automatic when unpacking an NCCH partition). Needs a specific file name (exheader.bin, extheader.bin or DecryptedExtHeader.bin) to be recognized. Outputs as a TXTree
*	unpack.ExeFS:
	*	Unpack ExeFS images (automatic when unpacking an NCCH partition). The file must have the .exefs extension or be "exefs.bin" or "DecryptedExeFS.bin" to be recognized
*	unpack.RomFS:
	*	Unpack RomFS images (automatic when unpacking an NCCH partition). The file must have the .romfs extension or be "romfs.bin" or "DecryptedRomFS.bin" to be recognized [Actually not completely implemented]

Dependencies
============
To access all 3DSkit functionnalities, you need:

*	python3 (tested under python 3.5 and 3.6, but it should work from 3.2 to 3.6+)
*	Pillow (Fork of PIL, use sudo apt-get install python3-pil)
*	struct (it should be installed by default with python3)

Contributing
============

Before submitting an issue, take a look at the program's help (-H option), your problem can be normal, or already explained there.
Don't forget to check if the issue has not been already reported, or fixed (check also in the closed ones).
Check also if you have the last commit
Then, if you really found a new issue, you should precise:

*	Your python version
*	The error output in the console
*	Attach the concerned file and if possible and necessary, a screenshot of the problem in the game.

Pull requests are grantly appreciated. You can see a guide for the 3DSkit's developper interface in the program's help (-H option), and a documentation for rawutil in the [rawutil's repo](https://github.com/Tyulis/rawutil)
